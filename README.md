# 4reMarkable
A collection of my scripts for the reMarkable tablet.

There is not yet a lot here to say, currently all necessary information is in the actual script. 

I might add more of my reMarkable-related scripts here, so there's a little README to start with.

*NCcalendar4reMarkable.sh* provides a script to download a personal calendar from a Nextcloud instance and convert it into a PDF that makes sense on a reMarkable tablet.

Currently, I still use the USB web interface either using usb proper or via WiFi as I still haven't found a solution to push PDFs to either the tablet directly or using the cloud API that makes me happy. There are lots of such solutions around and many people have already found theirs. As soon as I feel comfortable with one or the other, I shall include such a direct upload of my reMarkable files here.
